# Coffee Roaster V2

This project is a redesign of the coffee roaster controls that were implemented over a decade ago. In that previous design, the low level control circuits were installed within the coffee roaster itself. Years of operation in the elevated temperatures combined with dust from the roasting process have made maintenance of the circuits difficult at best, not to mention the tight fit of these circuits within the roaster.
