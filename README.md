# Coffee Roaster V2 Node Red 

This is the Node Red code for the Coffee Roaster V2 project. 
It resides in a separate Git repository from the Arduino code and project documentation, so I had to put it in this separate Github project.
This was done to facilitate using the project facilities of Node Red to manage the source code through Git/Github.
Please refer to the CoffeeRoasterV2 repository for documentation on this project.
